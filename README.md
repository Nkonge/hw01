My name is Nkonge Kagwiria Regina, a graduate student (class of 2020) at Harris School of Public Policy, *studying MA International Development and Policy. I come from Kenya and I am an Obama Foundation Scholar. My policy interests are international development, security, conflict and humanitarian intervention as well as technology and education*. 
Prior to coming to Harris my work focused on technology for development particularly the application of technology in higher education, refugee camps and hard to reach areas. I hold an MSc. in Information Systems Security and Digital Forensics.

## HOW I CREATED THIS FILE

    1. I installed Git (R studio was already installed in my computer)
    2. I forked and cloned the hw01 repository
    3. I opened the README file using R Studio and Git as the version control software
    4. I edited the README using RMarkdown: added the following sections - about me, purpose of this project, how I created this file
    5. I staged and commited the file, then pushed it to GitHub
 
## REFLECTION
<center>

The process was a bit confusing because at first I was using GitHub desktop, only to realize that Git and GitHub are different. 
Secondly, I had at first, created a separate file from the README, and practised RMarkdown skills on the separate file. I later realized that I can edit the README directly using RMarkdown and that there was no need to create a different file.
